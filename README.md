# Project Future - ReGeneration - Data and Decision Sciences

This is my team's project for the program Data and Decision Scieces offered by Code.Hub!

Under `data/` you will find the files we used for this project.

The goal of this project was the analysis of bank data to produce value for
a bank. Heuristic, statistical and machine learning techniques were used for
classification, user modeling, clustering and churn analysis.
